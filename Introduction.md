Want a quick introduction to DCI? First, it stands for _Data, Context_ and _Interaction_. Those are the three fundamental elements of the DCI paradigm.

You can get a good start at the Wikipedia DCI site:

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_Context_and_Interaction

If you want an even more laid-back introduction, have a look at these flicks:
- [The DCI Architecture: Supporting the Agile Agenda](http://www.leansoftwarearchitecture.com/home/dci-tutorials)
by Jim Coplien
- [DCI in Practice](http://www.leansoftwarearchitecture.com/home/dci-tutorials)
by Rickard &#214;berg.
- [DCI: Re-thinking the foundations of object-orientation and of programming](http://www.leansoftwarearchitecture.com/home/dci-tutorials)
by Trygve Reenskaug.

Otherwise, please browse the site. There are [documents](http://fulloo.info/Documents/), [examples](http://fulloo.info/Examples/), and many more goodies to look at.

If you want to get involved, sign up for the [object-composition](http://groups.google.com/group/object-composition) mailing list. That's where the DCI people hang out to ask questions and discuss progress.
